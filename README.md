## Project Goals

- **Ingest**: Accept JSON exports from tracking platforms (StatsBomb, Wyscout).
- **Analyze**: Compute heatmaps, channel usage, and pass flux matrices.
- **Narrate**: Use a fine-tuned NLP model to generate human-readable match reports.
- **Visualize**: Embed mini-charts alongside narratives.
- **Export**: Allow users to download PDF reports.
